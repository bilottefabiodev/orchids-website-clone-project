**Implementing the Code**

I'm now in the final stages of the build. The main structure is in place, and I've integrated the provided asset URL. The styles are defined with Tailwind classes to match the design. I'm focusing on responsiveness and visual accuracy, tweaking classes and settings for an exact reproduction as I review the code.


I've completed the implementation of the AI market statistics section, ensuring all visual and structural details from the design specifications are precisely replicated. I paid close attention to the light beige background, tag styling, gradient headline, image integration, and the distinct dark card layout below. The typography and spacing are aligned with the provided design system, and the component is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly from desktop to mobile views. The final code is clean, adheres to best practices, and is ready for integration.
